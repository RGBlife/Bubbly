## TODO:
- [] Textbox doesn't sent when pressing enter
- [] texbox doesn't clear when sending
- [] No scroll when messages are overflowing
- [] Each message needs to be in a new line instead of inline
- [] Better overall styling
- [] Assign randomly generated names to each client (connection) and send that with the message
- [] Display message with client name
- [] 'You are connected' shouldn't be a message event, maybe a toaster that displays for 5 seconds
